  <h1>When Should You Use Hypermedia?</h1>

  <blockquote>
<p>The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades efficiency, since information is transferred in a 
standardized form rather than one which is specific to an application‚Äôs needs. The REST interface is designed to be 
efficient for large-grain hypermedia data transfer, optimizing for the common case of the Web, but resulting in an
interface that is not optimal for other forms of architectural interaction.</p>

<p><em>-Roy Fielding, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5">https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5</a></em></p>
<p>We are obviously fans of hypermedia and think that it can address, at least in part, many of the problems that the web 
development world is facing today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypermedia is often <a href="../a-real-world-react-to-htmx-port/index.html">significantly less complex</a> than an SPA approach would 
be for many problems</li>
<li>Hypermedia allows your application API to be <a href="../hateoas/index.html">much more aggressively refactored and optimized</a></li>
<li>Hypermedia takes pressure off adopting a particular server technology, since you do not have an extensive JavaScript
front-end code base</li>
</ul>
<p>With <a href="../../index.html">htmx</a> and the additional UX possibilities that it gives you, we believe that many modern web applications can be built 
using HTML and the hypermedia paradigm.</p>
<p>With that being said, as with all technical choices, there are tradeoffs associated with hypermedia.  In this article
we will give you some ways to think about if hypermedia will be a good fit for an application or feature you are building.</p>
<h2 id="transitional-applications-hypermedia"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#transitional-applications-hypermedia" aria-label="Anchor link for: transitional-applications-hypermedia">üîó</a>Transitional Applications &amp; Hypermedia</h2>
<p>Before we get into the details of when hypermedia is a good choice, we‚Äôd like to clarify that adopting hypermedia is not
an <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Either/Or">either/or</a> decision when building a web application.  Even the most Single-y
of Single Page Applications utilizes hypermedia after all: as a bootstrap mechanism, to start the application.</p>
<p>In his talk, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=860d8usGC0o">Have SPAs Ruined The Web</a>, Rich Harris gives us the term
‚ÄúTransitional‚Äù Applications, that is applications that <em>mix</em> both hypermedia and non-hypermedia (SPA) concepts.  We
have responded to Mr. Harris‚Äô talk <a href="../a-response-to-rich-harris/index.html">in more detail here</a>, but suffice to say we 
violently agree with him that a pragmatic ‚ÄúTransitional‚Äù approach to web development is best: you should use the
right tool for the particular job you are working on.</p>
<p>Where we would likely disagree with Mr. Harris is where ‚Äúthe line‚Äù is between features that can be implemented
effectively in hypermedia and features that require a more sophisticated client-side approach.  We feel that, with htmx,
hypermedia can go much, much further than many web developers today believe is possible.  And, further, that, for many
applications, it can address many or all of their UX needs.</p>
<h2 id="hypermedia-a-good-fit-if"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#hypermedia-a-good-fit-if" aria-label="Anchor link for: hypermedia-a-good-fit-if">üîó</a>Hypermedia: A Good Fit If‚Ä¶</h2>
<h3 id="if-your-ui-is-mostly-text-images"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#if-your-ui-is-mostly-text-images" aria-label="Anchor link for: if-your-ui-is-mostly-text-images">üîó</a><em>‚Ä¶If your UI is mostly text &amp; images</em></h3>
<p>In <a href="../a-real-world-react-to-htmx-port/index.html">The Mother Of All htmx Demos</a>, David Guillot of Contexte shows how replacing
React with htmx lead to a 67% reduction in the total codebase, along with numerous other eye-popping results.</p>
<p>As much as we would like to claim that every team moving from React to htmx would experience these results, the fact is that the
Contexte web application is <em>extremely amenable</em> to the hypermedia style.</p>
<p>What makes Contexte so perfect for hypermedia is that it is a media-oriented web application, showing articles consisting
of text and images for reading.  It has a sophisticated filtering mechanism and other niceties, but the crux of the
application is displaying and categorizing articles.  This is exactly the sort of thing that hypermedia was designed to
do, and this is why htmx and hypermedia worked so well for their application.</p>
<h3 id="if-your-ui-is-crud-y"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#if-your-ui-is-crud-y" aria-label="Anchor link for: if-your-ui-is-crud-y">üîó</a><em>‚Ä¶If your UI is CRUD-y</em></h3>
<p>Another area where hypermedia has a long track-record of success is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>-y
web applications, in the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> style.  If your main application mechanic is showing
forms and saving the forms into a database, hypermedia can work very well.</p>
<p>And, with htmx, it can also be <a href="../../examples/click-to-edit/index.html">very smooth</a>, and not just constrained
to the simple <a href="../../examples/edit-row/index.html">list view/detail view</a> approach many server side applications take.</p>
<h3 id="if-your-ui-is-nested-with-updates-mostly-taking-place-within-well-defined-blocks"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#if-your-ui-is-nested-with-updates-mostly-taking-place-within-well-defined-blocks" aria-label="Anchor link for: if-your-ui-is-nested-with-updates-mostly-taking-place-within-well-defined-blocks">üîó</a><em>‚Ä¶If your UI is ‚Äúnested‚Äù, with updates mostly taking place within well-defined blocks</em></h3>
<p>One area where hypermedia can start to go a little wobbly is when you have UI dependencies that span structural
areas of the screen.  A good example of this, and one that often comes up when discussing the hypermedia approach, is the issue
count number shown on the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/issues">‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab</a> in GitHub.  For a long time, 
when you closed an issue on GitHub, the issue count on the tab did not update properly.  GitHub, in general (although
not exclusively), uses a hypermedia-style application.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAh ha!‚Äù, exclaims the SPA enthusiast, ‚ÄúSee, even GitHub can‚Äôt get this right!‚Äù</p>
<p>Well, GitHub has fixed the issue, but it does demonstrate a problem with the hypermedia approach: how do you update
disjoint parts of the UI cleanly?  htmx offers <a href="../../examples/update-other-content/index.html">a few techniques for making this work</a>,
and Contexte, in their talk, discuss handling this situation very cleanly, using the event approach.</p>
<p>But, let us grant that this is an area where the hypermedia approach can get into trouble.  To avoid this problem, one
potential strategy is to colocate dependent elements for a given resource within a given region or area on the screen in an
application.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a contact application whose detail screen for displaying and editing a contact has:</p>
<ul>
<li>An area for basic contact information</li>
<li>An area for the contact‚Äôs emails, and the count of those emails</li>
<li>An area for the contact‚Äôs phone numbers, and the count of those phone numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>This UI could be laid out in the following manner:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/nesting-example.png" alt="Nested Example" /></p>
<p>In this scenario, each subsection can have its own dedicated hypermedia end-points:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/contacts/&lt;id&gt;/details</code> for the first name/last name/ etc. info</li>
<li><code>/contacts/&lt;id&gt;/emails</code> for the email section</li>
<li><code>/contacts/&lt;id&gt;/phonenumbers</code> for the phone numbers section</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick here is that the email and phone counts are co-located on the screen with their collections, which allows you to 
<a href="../../attributes/hx-target/index.html">target</a> just that particular area for update when a modification is made to the respective 
collections.  All the data dependencies are co-located within a single area that can be updated via a single, simple
and obvious target, and that, further, don‚Äôt interfere with one another when they are replaced.</p>
<p>Each area effectively forms a sort of server-side component, independent of the other areas on the screen, and they are
all nested within a broader contact detail user interface.</p>
<h4 id="a-side-node-ui-driven-hypermedia-apis"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#a-side-node-ui-driven-hypermedia-apis" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-side-node-ui-driven-hypermedia-apis">üîó</a>A Side Node: UI Driven Hypermedia APIs</h4>
<p>Note that our hypermedia API (i.e. our end-points) in this case is <em>driven by the UI</em>: we have a particular UI layout 
that we want to achieve, and we adapt our API to that.  If the UI changed, we would have no qualms with completely changing
our API to satisfy the new requirements.  This is a <a href="../hateoas/index.html">unique aspect</a> of developing with
hypermedia, and we <a href="../hypermedia-apis-vs-data-apis/index.html">discuss it in more detail here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, there may be UI requirements that do not allow for grouping of dependent element in this manner and, if
the techniques <a href="../../examples/update-other-content/index.html">mentioned above</a> aren‚Äôt satisfactory, then it may be 
time to consider an alternative approach.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-need-deep-links-good-first-render-performance"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#if-you-need-deep-links-good-first-render-performance" aria-label="Anchor link for: if-you-need-deep-links-good-first-render-performance">üîó</a><em>‚Ä¶If you need ‚Äúdeep links‚Äù &amp; good first-render performance</em></h3>
<p>A final area where hypermedia outperforms other options is when you need ‚Äúdeep links‚Äù, that is, links into your
application that go beyond the landing page, or when you need excellent first-render performance.</p>
<p>Since hypermedia is the natural language of the web, and since browsers are very good at rendering HTML given a URL, 
using this approach is hard to beat for ‚Äútraditional‚Äù web features such as these.</p>
<h2 id="hypermedia-not-a-good-fit-if"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#hypermedia-not-a-good-fit-if" aria-label="Anchor link for: hypermedia-not-a-good-fit-if">üîó</a>Hypermedia: Not A Good Fit If‚Ä¶</h2>
<h3 id="if-your-ui-has-many-dynamic-interdependencies"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#if-your-ui-has-many-dynamic-interdependencies" aria-label="Anchor link for: if-your-ui-has-many-dynamic-interdependencies">üîó</a><em>‚Ä¶If your UI has many, dynamic interdependencies</em></h3>
<p>As we discussed above in the section on ‚Äúnested‚Äù UIs, one area where hypermedia can have trouble is when there are 
many UI dependencies spread across your UI and you can‚Äôt afford to ‚Äúupdate the whole UI‚Äù.  This is what Roy Fielding was
getting at in the quote at the top of this article: the web was designed for large-grain hypermedia data transfers, not
for lots of small data exchanges.</p>
<p>Particularly difficult for hypermedia to handle is when these dependencies are dynamic, that is, they depend on information
that cannot be determined at server-side render-time.  A good example of this is something like a spreadsheet: a user can
enter an arbitrary function into a cell and introduce all sorts of dependencies on the screen, on the fly.</p>
<p>(Note, however, that for many applications, the <a href="../../examples/edit-row/index.html">‚Äúeditable row‚Äù</a> pattern is an 
acceptable alternative to more general spreadsheet-like behavior, and this pattern does play well with hypermedia by 
isolating edits within a bounded area.)</p>
<h3 id="if-you-require-offline-functionality"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#if-you-require-offline-functionality" aria-label="Anchor link for: if-you-require-offline-functionality">üîó</a><em>‚Ä¶If you require offline functionality</em></h3>
<p>The hypermedia distributed architecture leans heavily on the server side for rendering representations of resources. When
a server is down or unreachable, the architecture will obviously have trouble.  It is possible to use Service Workers
to handle offline requests (although this is a complex option), and it is also easy to detect when a hypermedia 
application is offline and show an offline message, as many thick-client application do.</p>
<p>But if your application requires full functionality in an offline environment, then the hypermedia approach is not
going to be an acceptable one.</p>
<h3 id="if-your-ui-state-is-updated-extremely-frequently"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#if-your-ui-state-is-updated-extremely-frequently" aria-label="Anchor link for: if-your-ui-state-is-updated-extremely-frequently">üîó</a><em>‚Ä¶If your UI state is updated extremely frequently</em></h3>
<p>Another situation where hypermedia is not going to be a good approach is if your UI state is updated frequently.  A good
example is an online game that needs to capture mouse movements.  Putting a hypermedia network request in-between a mouse
move and a UI update will not work well, and you would be far better off writing your own client-side state management
for the game and syncing with a server using a different technology.</p>
<p>Of course, your game may also have a setting page and that setting page might be better done with hypermedia than
whatever solution you use for the core of your game.  There is nothing wrong with mixing approaches, in the Transitional
style!</p>
<p>We should note, however, that it is typically easier to embed SPA components <em>within</em> a larger hypermedia
architecture, than vice-versa.  Isolated client-side components can communicate with a broader hypermedia application
via <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events">events</a>, in the manner demonstrated
in the <a href="../../examples/sortable/index.html">drag-and-drop Sortable.js + htmx</a> example.</p>
<h3 id="if-your-team-is-not-on-board"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#if-your-team-is-not-on-board" aria-label="Anchor link for: if-your-team-is-not-on-board">üîó</a><em>‚Ä¶If your team is not on board</em></h3>
<p>A final reason to not choose hypermedia isn‚Äôt technical, but rather sociological: currently, hypermedia simply isn‚Äôt
in favor in web development.  Many companies have adopted React as their standard library for building web applications.<br />
Many developers and consultants have bet their careers on it.  Many hiring managers have never heard of hypermedia, let
alone htmx, but put React on every job they post out of habit.  It is certainly much easier to hire for!</p>
<p>While this is frustrating, it is a real phenomenon and should be borne in mind with humility.  Although Contexte
was able to rewrite their application quickly and effectively in htmx, not all teams are as small, agile and
passionate, nor are all applications such slam dunks for the approach.  It may be better to adopt hypermedia around
the edges, perhaps for internal tools first, to prove its value first, before taking a broader look at it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">üîó</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We are often asked: ‚ÄúOK, so what sorts of applications <strong>wouldn‚Äôt</strong> htmx be good for‚Äù.  We prefer to think about
things on a feature-by-feature basis using the ‚ÄúTransitional‚Äù application concept, but it is useful to have some
broad, popular applications in mind when thinking about just how much might be done in hypermedia versus other
approaches.</p>
<p>To give an example of two famous applications that we think <em>could</em> be implemented cleanly in hypermedia, consider 
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> or <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://gmail.com/">GMail</a>.  Both web applications are text-and-image heavy, with
coarse-grain updates and, thus, would be quite amenable to a hypermedia approach.</p>
<p>Two famous examples of web applications that would <em>not</em> be amenable to a hypermedia approach are 
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a> and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>.  Google Sheets can have
a large amounts of state within and interdependencies between many cells, making it untenable to issue a server request on every
cell update.  Google Maps, on the other hand, responds rapidly to mouse movements and simply can‚Äôt afford a server round trip for
every one of them.  Both of these applications require a much more sophisticated client-side setup than what hypermedia 
can provide.</p>
<p>Of course, the vast majority of web applications are nowhere near the scale and complexity of these examples. And almost 
every web application, even Google Sheets or Google Maps, has parts where, potentially, the hypermedia approach would be
better: simpler, faster and cleaner.</p>
<p>Having hypermedia as a tool in your tool-chest will improve your ability to address engineering problems as a web
developer, even if it doesn‚Äôt become your favorite hammer.  There is a good <a href="../hateoas/index.html">theoretical basis</a> 
for the approach, <a href="../a-real-world-react-to-htmx-port/index.html">practical benefits for many applications</a>,
and it is ‚Äúwith the grain‚Äù of the web in a way that other approaches are not.</p>

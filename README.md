# WebServer

## Stuff I wanna do

- Tools:

  - [ ] Automatically rebuild any .cpp file that has been changed in handlers
  - [ ] A good logger with request time and all (like [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)) (maybe using [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog))
    - [ ] Log to file

- Server:

  - [ ] A good config file (maybe using [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)) (_If needed_)
  - [ ] Routing system like [next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)

- Handlers:
  - [ ] Ability to stream files like video or audio

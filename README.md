## Stuff I wanna do

- Tools:

  - [x] Automatically rebuild any .cpp file that has been changed in the `api` folder ([Reference](#hotreload))
    - [x] Currently, if the hot reloader is started and we shhut down the server and open it back up, the hot reloader will not work as it has the incorrect PID.
    - [x] When we start the project with watch mode, the hot reloader is not started
    - [x] Hot reloader should know the set folder for endpoints and not have to be passed as an argument
    - [x] Faster boot up time (compiling the shared library takes a lot of time, make it into it's own thread)
    - [x] Remove infinite loop and use a signal to start/stop the hot reloader
  - [x] A good logger with request time and all (like [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)) using [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
    - [ ] Date and time support
    - [x] Log to file
  - [x] Unit testing server with [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
  - [ ] Call Javascript functions from C++ [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2713289/how-to-execute-javascript-function-in-c)
  - [ ] Dockerize the project (_If needed_)
  - [x] Being able to show the server to other devices on the network (using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)?)
  - [x] Scripts to build the project in either development or production mode and run it.

- Server:

  - [x] A good config file system using [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) ([Reference](#config-file))
    - Add options as the project goes on
  - [x] The ability to write command to the server like `stop` or `status` or `help`
  - [x] [Routing system](#routing-system) like [next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)
  - [ ] A way to handle sessions (MAYBE)
  - [x] Upload of files to the server

- Endpoints:

  - [x] Ability to stream files like video or audio efficiently (not downloading 1GB of data straight on loading) (**Which was the reason I started this project**) ([Reference](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-video-streaming-server-node/))
  - [x] Express interface
    - [x] Middleware support [Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware)
    - [x] Res and Req from [req](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#req) and [res](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#res) <span style="color:red">(Not everything is implemented yet)</span>.
  - [ ] A system to communicate with databases / have modules that every endpoint can access

- Hosting:

  - [ ] A way to host the server on a VPS (using [docker](https://www.docker.com/))

- Optimisation

  - [x] Asynchronous endpoints and read/write (I use thread)
  - [ ] A way to measure the performance of the server using [google benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark)
  - [ ] A way to optimise the server to handle a lot of requests (maybe using [libuv](https://libuv.org/))
  - [ ] Reduce memory footprint
  - [ ] Reduce CPU usage

### Architecture

The server is composed of 3 main parts:

- The server itself
- The endpoints
- The hot reloader

The server is the main part of the project. It is the one that handles the requests and sends them to the endpoints. It also handles the config file and the logger.

The endpoints are the files that are loaded by the server and are used to handle the requests. They are compiled into a shared library and loaded by the server.

The hot reloader is a separate project that is used to watch for changes in the endpoints folder and rebuild the shared library. It is also able to send a signal to the server to reload the endpoints.

### Internal system of the server

I would like to have MAX_THREAD number of threads that are always running and waiting for a request. When a request comes in, it is added to a queue and the first available thread will take it and handle it. If there are no available threads, the request is added to the queue and will be handled when a thread is available.

### Routing System

As of right now, we are loading the endpoints from compiled shared library in each folder using a Next like approach. We are able to manage all methods as long as they are defined, otherwise 404 is returned.

- [x] We want to support this type of route aswell
      `pages/blog/first-post.js` â†’ `/blog/first-post`
      `pages/dashboard/settings/username.js` â†’ `/dashboard/settings/username`
- [x] We are missing routing with parameter such as `/user/[id]` or `/user/[id]/[name]`
- [x] We are also missing this type of route `/user?id=1&name=John`
- [x] And we would also like to add a way to handle catch routes like

  - `/user/[...id]`
  - `/user/[...id]/[...otherID]`
  - `/user/[...id]/[...otherID]/name`
  - `/user/[...id]/[...otherID]/name/[...otherName]`

- [x] Also, we would like to handle optional parameters like `/user/[[id]]` or `/user/[[...id]]` (refer to [next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-routes) for more info)
- [x] We would like to add a way to handle redirects
- [ ] We would like to make the parameters in the route available in the endpoint like

  - `GET /user/[id]` â†’ `req.params.id`
  - `GET /user/[id]/[name]` â†’ `req.params.id` and `req.params.name`
  - `GET /user/[...id]` â†’ `req.params.id`
  - `GET /user/[...id]/[...otherID]` â†’ `req.params.id` and `req.params.otherID`

- [x] Adding ETag support [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4533/http-generating-etag-header)
- Support a maximum of header fields see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

### HotReload

- ðŸ”—[Github](https://github.com/MatteoTamine1709/CppHotReloader)

We now have a HotReloader projet which is able to watch for changes in the `api` folder and rebuild the shared library. We are now able to reload the endpoints without having to restart the server.
It works by watching for changes in the `api` folder and then rebuild the shared library. It then sends a signal to the server to reload the endpoints.

### Config File

The goal is to have a config file that can be used to configure the server using a config.json file. We would like to be able to configure the port, the host, the endpoints folder, public folder, is watching for changes, etc.
